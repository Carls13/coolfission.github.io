  <h1>Getting a Permit in GA</h1>
  	<p>Obtaining a permit in Georgia is a lot easier than one may think. In my personal experiences, it has actually taken a lot longer for me to get all of the neccessary documents than actually passing the test. </p>
  <h3>Requirements=</h3>
  	<p>The first thing that you want to do when applying for a permit, is to know if you are eligible. In Georgia, you must be at least 15 years old and a legal resident of the state.</p>
  	<p>Next, you want to do make sure you have all of the documents needed<br/><br/><strong>This includes:</strong></p>
  	<ul>
  		<li>US Passport</li>
  		<li>School Certificate of Attendance (Can be picked up in an attendance office at school</li>
  		<li>Social Security Card</li>
  	</ul>
