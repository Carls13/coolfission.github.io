  <h1>Getting a Permit in GA</h1>
  	<p>Obtaining a permit in Georgia is a lot easier than one may think. In my personal experiences, it has actually taken a lot longer for me to get all of the neccessary documents than actually passing the test. </p>
  <h2>Requirements</h3>
  	<p>The first thing that you want to do when applying for a permit, is to know if you are eligible. In Georgia, you must be at least 15 years old and a legal resident of the state.</p>
  	<p>Next, you want to do make sure you have all of the documents needed<br/><br/><strong>This includes:</strong></p>
  	<ul>
  		<li>US Passport</li>
  		<li>School Certificate of Attendance (Can be picked up in an attendance office at school</li>
  		<li>Social Security Card</li>
  		<li>10 dollars</li>
  	</ul>

  <h2>Preparing for the Exam</h3>
  	<p>After obtaining all of these documents, you want to prepare for the exam by taking practice tests online. While there is one practice on the DMV site, the most helpful one that I've used is here: <a href="https://driving-tests.org/">https://driving-tests.org/</a> On this website, make sure to do the practice exam simulator multiple times, as this is extremely helpful for the test and avoids a lot of the time needed in order to read the handbook.</p>
  	<p>Preparing for the exam should not take too long and should only take a few days max if you refer to the website. Furthermore, you don't want to spend too much time preparing as your Certificate of Attendance may only be valid for a limited amount of time. After studying for the exam, make sure that you look at the hours that the nearest DMV center has and if it is open. This is important as their are usually long lines there if the center is open and it is not worth going all the way just to see that it's closed.</p>

  <h2>The Exam</h2>
  	<p>Before even taking the written exam, you will have a vision test where you will be required to read a few letters on a screen. As a result, make sure that you wear your glasses/contact if you have them. It is essential that you pass this part of the exam because if you don't, then you will not be able to take the written portion.</p>
  	<p>The next part of the exam is the written portion. This section is divided into two parts which includes symbols and what to do in certain situations. Both of these parts are 20 questions each. Now on the actual exam, you can only get 5 questions wrong per section and you can't skip any questions. This is different than the practice test website that I have suggested, but the content from that website is still the same than on what is on the exam. </p>
