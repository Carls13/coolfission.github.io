The arguments in this section can win debates, but over the long term, they'll lose to arguments drawn

read different advantages and disadvantages, and support the basic arguments found here. As the year

                        The Affirmative
                    </h4>
The affirmative plan is for the federal government give incentives for offshore wind. The advantage is
global warming: the affirmative argues that offshore wind is plentiful, efficient, and clean, and can
power a third of the U.S. That helps mitigate the worst effects of global warming, which will otherwise
cause natural disasters that lead millions of people to lose their homes and become refugees.

                        The Economy Disadvantage
                    </h4>
The economy disadvantage argues that the economy, which is fragile now, will be severely harmed by
investment in offshore wind. The Hanson evidence gives several reasons for this, including cost, an
increase in electricity prices, and a tradeoff with more important parts of the economy. The Bradford
evidence impacts this by arguing that an economic decline now would threaten to throw 900 million
people around the world into poverty.

Contention 1 is Inherency  
The PTC is a crucial incentive for wind energy, but Congress allowed it to expire in 2013
Union of Concerned Scientists, 14 (An environmental advocacy organization composed of scientists and non-
scientists. “Production Tax Credit for Renewable Energy,” 1/31/14.

</h3>
The Production Tax Credit (PTC) is a federal incentive that provides financial support for the
development of renewable energy facilities.
Companies that generate electricity from wind, geothermal, and “closed-loop” bioenergy (using
dedicated energy crops) are eligible for a federal PTC, which provides a 2.3-cent per kilowatt-hour
(kWh) incentive for the first ten years of a renewable energy facility's operation. 
Other technologies, such as "open-loop" biomass (using farm and forest wastes rather than dedicated energy crops),
efficiency upgrades and capacity additions for existing hydroelectric facilities, small irrigation systems, landfill gas, and
municipal solid waste (MSW), receive a lesser value tax credit of 1.1 cents per kWh.
The production tax credit for wind and other renewable energy technologies expired at the end of 2013.
However, an important new provision was included in the American Taxpayer Relief Act of 2012 (enacted in January 2013) allowing
eligible projects that were under construction before January 1, 2014 to qualify for the PTC. The IRS issued guidelines in April 2013, and
again in September 2013, clarifying several issues around what is needed to qualify as under construction.
<h3>
Contention 2 is our advantage – Global Warming
Global warming is real, caused by humans, and happening now. There is no other explanation for
heat waves and droughts sweeping the globe
Hansen, 12 (James, former director of the NASA Goddard Institute for Space Studies, leading climate science expert.

In a new analysis of the past six decades of global temperatures, which will be published Monday, my
colleagues and I have revealed a stunning increase in the frequency of extremely hot summers, with
deeply troubling ramifications for not only our future but also for our present.
This is not a climate model or a prediction but actual observations of weather events and temperatures
that have happened. Our analysis shows that it is no longer enough to say that global warming will
increase the likelihood of extreme weather and to repeat the caveat that no individual weather event can be directly
linked to climate change. To the contrary, our analysis shows that, for the extreme hot weather of the recent
past, there is virtually no explanation other than climate change.
The deadly European heat wave of 2003, the fiery Russian heat wave of 2010 and catastrophic
droughts in Texas and Oklahoma last year can each be attributed to climate change. And once the data are
gathered in a few weeks’ time, it’s likely that the same will be true for the extremely hot summer the United States is
suffering through right now.
These weather events are not simply an example of what climate change could bring. They are caused
by climate change. The odds that natural variability created these extremes are minuscule, vanishingly
small. To count on those odds would be like quitting your job and playing the lottery every morning to pay the bills.

Natural disasters from global warming will lead to millions of climate refugees. The U.S. has a
moral obligation to address the impact of its carbon emissions on other countries
Center for American Progress, 07 (Left-wing think tank, “Global warming will spur migration,” 7-3-07.
http://americanprogress.org/issues/green/news/2007/07/03/3295/climate-refugees-global-warming-will-spur-migration/)
</h3>
Debate over comprehensive immigration reform may have stalled last week in the Senate, but there’s one key concern
that’s just warming up: the exacerbating effect that droughts, severe weather, food shortages, disease,
and sea level rises will have on migration.
Worldwide environmental, economic, and social consequences from existing atmospheric greenhouse gas
concentrations, even if we were to cease emissions today, will drive migration around the globe. Attention to the
migration pressures resulting from global warming should therefore be an essential aspect of a long-term U.S. immigration
plan. This will not only focus efforts on helping populations adapt to climate change, but also encourage thought on how to
alleviate migration pressures.
According to the International Federation of Red Cross, climate change disasters are already a bigger cause of
population displacement than war and persecution. Estimates of climate refugees currently range from
25 to 50 million. And this April, global scientific experts and former U.S. military leaders warned in two
reports—the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change’s Fourth Assessment and the CNA Corporation’s “National
Security and the Threat of Climate Change”—that the effects of global warming are likely to trigger conflict and
mass migrations of affected people.
Large numbers of immigrants to the United States currently come from Mexico and the Caribbean, and with increases in
storm intensity, stress on natural resources, and rising sea levels—side effects already affecting these regions—immigration
levels will only increase. Northern Mexico’s severe water shortages will drive immigration into the United
States despite the increasingly treacherous border terrain. The damage caused by storms and rising sea levels in
the coastal areas of the Caribbean Islands—where 60 percent of the population live—will likewise
increase the flow of immigrants from the region and generate political tension.
The United States cannot ignore the potentially heightened flow of displaced peoples as it continues to
discuss immigration reform. Because we shoulder a large portion of the responsibility for the current levels
of global warming pollution in the atmosphere, we have a moral responsibility to invest in solutions that
will help ourselves and the world—particularly poor countries—adapt and prevent the growing implications of
climate change.
The countries least responsible for greenhouse gas emissions are frequently the most vulnerable to global warming’s earliest
effects. Developing countries bear minimal responsibility for climate change because they have little
industry and produce relatively small amounts of pollution. But their populations—often the poorest of
the world’s people—are more likely to occupy vulnerable locations such as coast lines, flood plains,
and steep slopes and live in structures unable to withstand severe weather events. The governments of these
poor countries therefore carry the largest burden associated with climate change and are ill-equipped to recover from
disasters and meet the basic needs of their citizens.
The United States therefore owes a “climate debt” that it needs to pay back to these poor countries. China may have
recently surpassed the United States in terms of overall greenhouse gas emissions, but the United States
has still had the largest historical greenhouse gas emissions as well as the greatest per capita emissions.
Each American citizen on average produces four times the amount of greenhouse gas as an average
Chinese citizen. And, unfortunately, because greenhouse gases can persist in the atmosphere for hundreds of years, the
world will be experiencing the negative effects of these disproportionately large U.S. emissions for years to come.

Offshore wind is the key renewable energy source – it can power a third of the country
Burger, 12 (Andrew, independent environmental journalist. “Offshore Wind Turbines Can Power the Entire East Coast,”
9-25-12.
http://www.triplepundit.com/2012/09/atlantic-offshore-wind-turbines/)
</h3>
Offshore winds off the U.S. Atlantic coast could yield enough clean, renewable electrical power for at
least one-third of the entire U.S., or the entire East Coast, from Maine to Florida, according to a Stanford
University study released Sept. 14. That includes some of the country’s largest urban centers, as well as
the nation’s capital.
The Stanford research team employed a state-of-the-art offshore wind power model to simulate the
installation of 144,000 5-megawatt wind turbines of the type typically found in European offshore wind farms at various
ocean depths and distances from shore from Florida to Maine, concentrating them in the typically hurricane-free stretch of
the Atlantic between Maine and Virginia, according to a Stanford University News report.
Now’s the time for U.S. offshore wind power development
They found that offshore winds off the U.S. East Coast produce between 965-1,372-terawatt-hours of
electricity per year, enough to meet 1/3 of U.S. electricity demand, or all the power needs of the entire East
Coast, from Maine to Florida. The study, “U.S. East Coast Offshore Wind Energy Resources and Their Relationship to
Peak-Time Electricity Demand,” is available here.
In addition to adding significantly to the U.S. East Coast offshore wind power potential, the researchers found that
East Coast offshore wind energy peaks in the middle of the day. That coincides exactly with peak
power demands.
“We knew there was a lot of wind out there, but this is the first actual quantification of the total resource and
the time of day that the resource peaks,” commented Stanford University professor of civil and
environmental engineeering Mark Z. Jacobson, who directed the research project. “This provides practical
information to wind farm developers about the best areas to place turbines.”
Added research team member and recent Atmosphere/Energy PhD program graduate Mike Dvorak, “People mistakenly
think that wind energy is not useful because output from most land-based turbines peaks in the late
evening/early morning, when electricity demand is low. “The real value of offshore wind energy is that
it often peaks when we need the most electricity – during the middle of the day.”
So, we propose the following plan: The United States federal government should offer a long-
term production tax credit for wind energy generated off the coast of the Atlantic Ocean.
<h3>
Contention 3 is Solvency -
The PTC is the single most important incentive for developing wind energy – a long-term
extension of the PTC will spark massive investment in wind
Union of Concerned Scientists, 14 (An environmental advocacy organization composed of scientists and non-
scientists. “Production Tax Credit for Renewable Energy,” 1/31/14.
http://www.ucsusa.org/clean_energy/smart-energy-
solutions/increase-renewables/production-tax-credit-for.html)
</h3>
Combined with state renewable electricity standards, the PTC has been a major driver of wind power
development in the United States. This development has resulted in significant economic benefits, according to the
U.S. Department of Energy:
Between 2007 and 2012, U.S. wind capacity more than tripled, representing an annual average
investment of $18 billion. 
More than 550 manufacturing facilities located in 44 states produce 72 percent of the wind turbines and components
installed in the United States, up from 25 percent in 2006. 
The cost of generating electricity from wind has fallen by more than 40 percent over the past three
years. 
But Congress has repeatedly gone back and forth between expiring and extending the PTC, which has
wreaked havoc on the wind industry.
Originally enacted as part of the Energy Policy Act of 1992, Congress has extended the provision five times and has allowed
it to expire on five occasions. This "on-again/off-again" status has resulted in a boom-bust cycle of
development. In the years following expiration, installations dropped between 76 and 93 percent , with
corresponding job losses (see Figure below). 
The cycle begins with the industry experiencing strong growth in development around the country while the PTC is firmly
in place, and in the years leading up to the PTC's expiration. Lapses in the PTC then cause a dramatic slowdown
in the implementation of planned wind projects and layoffs at wind companies and manufacturing facilities.
Upon restoration, the wind power industry takes time to regain its footing, and then experiences strong
growth until the tax credits expire. And so on.
Short-term extensions of the PTC are insufficient for sustaining the long-term growth of renewable
energy. The planning and permitting process for new wind facilities can take up to two years or longer
to complete. As a result, many renewable energy developers that depend on the PTC to improve a
facility's cost effectiveness may hesitate to start a new project due to the uncertainty that the credit will
still be available to them when the project is completed.
Last-minute PTC extensions don’t serve anyone well either. The pending uncertainty threatens access to financing and stalls plans for development,
jeopardizing the tens of thousands of jobs in the industry. This uncertainty was clearly evident in 2013 when the PTC was extended two days after the 2012
expiration date and U.S. wind development hit its lowest level since 2004. However, a recent study by the American Wind Energy Association (AWEA)
shows that at least 12,000 MW of wind capacity is currently under construction and 5,200 MW of capacity that signed power purchase agreements in 2013
could be eligible for the PTC under the new IRS guidelines.
A long-term extension of the PTC is needed to bring more stability to the wind industry, and help level the playing field with fossi l fuels and nuclear
power— industries that have received far greater taxpayer support for decades.
But most importantly, the PTC works. With it in place, wind power has dramatically increased, reducing
our reliance on fossil fuels, driving innovation and economic development, lowering costs, and
providing important environmental benefits— including carbon reductions.

A PTC for offshore wind will create jobs and solve global warming

Offshore Wind” Published 9/13/12.
</h3>
As the clock ticks down for Congress to extend critical tax credits for wind power, a new report shows that with a step-up
in state and federal leadership, Georgia could realize the benefits of offshore wind.
Georgia has immense untapped offshore wind energy resources, and the new report “The Turning Point for
Atlantic Offshore Wind Energy,” written by the National Wildlife Federation and released today in Atlanta by Environment
Georgia identifies key building blocks that local, state, and federal officials have put in place to usher in a future with
offshore wind, including admission of Georgia into the Atlantic States Offshore Wind Consortium. 
“Essentially, Georgia has several dozen power plants waiting to be tapped off our coast, said Jennette
Gayer, Policy Advocate with Environment Georgia. “Unfortunately, when it comes to tapping that
potential, we are behind. To keep us in this race and make sure we can take advantage of this boon in
pollution-free energy and local jobs our leaders must act now.”
Environment Georgia called on leaders in Congress to extend the offshore wind tax credit before it
expires at the end of the year. They also urged Governor Nathan Deal to take steps to add Georgia to the Atlantic
States Offshore Wind Consortium, South Carolina, Georgia and Florida are the only states with Atlantic wind potential not
currently part of this Consortium designed to make wind development off the Atlantic Coast more efficient and coordinated.
The Atlantic coast is an ideal location for offshore wind energy because of its high electricity demand
and population density along the coast. Along the Atlantic coast alone, reaching the Department of
Energy’s (DOE) goal of 54 gigawatts of offshore wind power would reduce carbon pollution by the
equivalent of taking roughly 18 million cars off the road. Meeting this benchmark would also generate
$200 billion in new economic activity while creating more than 43,000 permanent, high-paying jobs in
manufacturing, construction, engineering, operations, and maintenance, according to the National Renewable
Energy Laboratory.

Americans remain pretty pessimistic about the economy. The National Bureau of Economic Research calculates
that the most recent recession began in December 2007 and ended in June 2009. But that is certainly news to most
Americans. In a March NBC News/Wall Street Journal poll, 57 percent of respondents said they believe we are
still in a recession, while 41 percent said we are not. Indeed, in the seven times that NBC/WSJ pollsters have asked the
question since the latter half of 2001, a majority of Americans have felt that we were in a recession.
While consumer confidence is on the rise and pretty close to the highest it has been since the last
recession began, we are nowhere near the levels of optimism and comfort that Americans felt during
the period of 1992 until this latest recession began in late 2007. We feel better, but nowhere near good.
The recent economic reports that we only had a one-tenth of a percentage point increase in the real gross domestic product
is attributed to an unusually harsh winter; but a vibrant economy doesn't sustain that kind of hit from a tough winter alone.
As Mesirow Financial's Chief Economist Diane Swonk put it in a recent report to clients: "The economy came to a virtual
standstill in the first quarter [of 2014], adding insult to injury to an economy still struggling to recover." She added that it
was "reflective of a fundamental weakening in a recovery that was already compromised." This was and remains a
very fragile economy.
The plan disrupts this delicate balance – a PTC for wind harms the economy by spending money
and diverting investment from more important priorities
Hanson, 14 (Christine Harbin, Federal Issues Campaign Manager for Americans for Prosperity, a conservative political
advocacy group. Published in Forbes on June 18, 2014. Available at
http://www.forbes.com/sites/realspin/2014/06/18/support-for-wind-subsidies-divides-republicans/)
In arguing that that tax credits are needed to boost employment in the wind industry, proponents
overlook what the rest of the economy gives up in exchange for them. In reality the PTC is a net jobs
loser—it distracts labor and capital away from more efficient areas in the economy and slows over all
growth. Wind turbine makers may be able to plump up their payrolls—just as any tax handout will boost employment in a
targeted industry—but the rest of the economy suffers as a result. Any boost in employment among wind turbine
makers is inherently temporary.
Compared to other forms of electricity generation, wind power is far from cost competitive. The wind PTC is an
outrageously large subsidy, leading to giant disruptions in the energy market. At $23 per megawatt-hour, the PTC is worth
half (and sometimes even more) of the entire wholesale price of electricity in many parts of the country. In fact, the PTC
is so lavish and anti-cost-competitive that wind power producers often bid negative prices into
electrical grid, just so they can collect the subsidy. They literally pay utilities to take their electricity.
Lawmakers should oppose resurrecting this tax break for wind energy because it’s costly, and increasingly so—the PTC cost
$12 billion in 2014, up from a historical average of $5 billion per year.
In practice, targeted subsidies are a tried-and-terrible way to develop new energy sources, Under President Obama’s
direction, the federal government has tried to prop up its favorite energy sources with targeted
subsidies—tax credits, grants, loan guarantees, state-based mandates, etc.—with little to show besides slower
economic growth. Too many of these pet projects have gone bankrupt and belly-up, sticking taxpayers
with the bill, and failing to get the U.S. any closer to its energy goals.

Hundreds of millions of people worldwide are on the brink of poverty.
A recent study by the International Monetary Fund warns that as many as 900 million people could fall
back into poverty in the event of an economic shock like the Great Recession. That figure is three times the size
of the U.S. population.
According to the World Bank, 1.2 billion people are currently living on less than $1.25 a day.
While the report acknowledges that progress has been to made to reduce global poverty and strengthen the
world economy following the financial crisis, the world is still in a vulnerable situation.
Global unemployment, for example, is the highest it's been in two decades with 40 percent of the world's population out of
work, according to the report.
And things could get much worse in the event of a macroeconomic shock, of which the Europe and U.S.
are dangerously close. The recent bailout of Cyprus threw the eurozone into chaos, igniting fears that the situation
could lead to the next financial crisis.
Here in the U.S., a series of automatic spending cuts know as the sequester could cost the economy
hundreds of thousands of jobs. The cuts have already threatened the stability of safety nets designed to
aid the nation's poorest..
The U.S. continues to fail to sustain a robust job market, adding only 88,000 jobs in March.

Just because we spend a small amount of money on wind turbines, the U.S. economy will not fall into a recession. Global Warming has a larger magnitude that an economic depression, which is an international issue, affects more people. The probability of Global Warming occurring is much greater than a recession, which is very unlikely. After all, we have recovered from all previous economic collapses in the past. Global Warming’s real climate refugees, and eventually extinction of species and decrease of bio diversity. Climate change disasters are already a bigger cause of the population displacement then war and persecution. Offshore wind can produce between 965 – 1,372 terawatts per hour, enough power to power 1/3 of the USA. Most of the wind flows during the day says Mike Dvorak, a PHD professor, when the U.S. most needs electricity.

The PTC and wind turbines provide financial support for wind energy. By doing this, we are slowing the heat waves, droughts, and climate change attributed to Global Warming. Because we are a major cause of the current Global Warming pollution, it’s our responsibility to act towards this issue. We can only do this by constructing wind turbines. Offshore wind can power the entire East Coast of the US. Additionally, the East Coast offshore wind peaks in the middle of the day, coinciding with the wind power demands. With the PTC in place, wind power development in the DS increases. A permanent tax incentive is necessary. It will reduce our reliance on fossil fuels, driving innovation and economic development, and lowering the cost of fossil fuels. In addition to solving Global Warming, the PTC will create jobs. This would generate an economic investment and create thousands of jobs, therefore boosting the economy. The probability of Global Warming occurring is much greater than a recession. The magnitude of this is much greater, affecting more people around the world. How likely is it that millions of people will fall into poverty simply because of an environmental investment? A permanent PTC and investment in wind turbines will benefit the US and the rest of the world. Global Warming is a current issue that is necessary for the US and other nations to focus and act upon.

Between 2007 and 2012, the U.S. wind capacity more than tripled, representing an annual average investment of $18 billion. Congress allowed the PTC to stay on/off. This boom/bust system cycle resulted in dropping of installations between 76% and 93%. It is important for Congress to extend the PTC, so wind companies can produce more energy. This will help create jobs and boost the economy. The U.S. produces the most co² emission so it’s important that U.S. helps its economy and the world by implementing wind turbines and the PTC. By doing this, Global Warming will slow down and the economy of the U.S. and others around the world will improve and grow. The Hanson 14 never said that the PTC will cause an economic decline. It will only cause a slower economic growth. Offshore wind production and maintenance will require many stables, high paying jobs which actually will decrease unemployment. There is no evidence that there is a direct link between and American economic decline causing a worldwide decline. Climate change causes huge natural disasters that will ruin the economy and cause even more damage than their DA. With floods, storms, and ocean addifications, climate change causes a much bigger economic decline. You mentioned that everyone in the world will have to use wind power for it to be successful, Global Warming is a current issue that will impact millions of people around the world. This could kill humans and a variety of species around the world, with a much greater impact than an economic recession, only causing unemployment and poverty. PTC and wind turbines are necessary on the East Coast of the U.S and will slow the effects of Global Warming and solve, not harm the economy.

Wind turbines have a critical economic disadvantage. The US economy remains fragile and many Americans remain pessimistic about it. The US cannot afford to spend millions of dollars on this cause. Wind turbines, in addition, to the PTC are anti-competitive and expensive, and many even go bankrupt. Such an economic shock would cause millions of people to fall into poverty. It simply would not work and will negatively affect the US and people around the world. The PTC is very expensive and may promote jobs, but by doing this, we are causing unemployment and homelessness for 900 million people around the world. The impact of a possible economic recession is much greater than that of Global Warming, taking years to occur. The magnitude of an economic collapse will disrupt a delicate balance in international trade. Does the US really want to spend millions of dollars, ignoring the needs of its citizens, in order to stop an inevitable outcome in the future? The US is not ready for such a decision which could impact each individual in the US, the PTC and wind turbines.
